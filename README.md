Repository of all my solved [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.  

Solving problems posted in Project Euler is one of the hobbies and passions of the author.  It began as a challenge over 13 years ago between the author's friends and himself regarding who gets to solve most problems.  As of this writing, the author has solved over 39 problems.  Over the years, the author has lost source codes for some of the problems he solved, so he thought of putting them in a centralized repository not to lose them again.

This repo contains solutions for 20 or so problems solved by him. 

Simple Java project that can be run on any known IDEs.  Just run the `main()` on each file.
