Repository of all my solved [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.  

Solving problems posted in Project Euler is one of my hobbies and passion.  It began as a challenge over 13 years ago between my friends and me as to who gets to solve most problems.  As of this writing, I have solved 39 problems.  Over the years, I've lost source codes for some of the problems I developed, so I thought of putting them in a centralized repository so that I won't lose them again.

This repo contains solutions for 20 or so problems solved by me.  If I could remember the sources for the remaining solved problems, I will commit those when I can.

Simple Java project that can be run on any known IDEs.  Just run the `main()` on each file.
